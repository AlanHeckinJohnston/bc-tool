This is a comparator software for businesses/individuals that track their money in Google Sheets.
It accepts a CSV from a bank detailing the transcations, and after logging in to Google Sheets, you can select the sheets and map the respective columns the data appears in.

After everything is complete, clicking "Match" will display a list of transactions "Missed" from the sheets that do appear in the google sheet.
It will also generate another spreadsheet 'report' that simply highlights everything green that does appear in the bank csv- this way you have a complete list of what is missing on both sides.

The google app credentials have been omitted from this commit, for obvious reasons. You'll need to put google's client_secret.json file in the directory with index.py in order to run it properly.
